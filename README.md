# Advent of Code - Solution Game Boy 

Very experimental and dirty implementations of [Advent of Code] solutions,
this time on the Nintendo Game Boy.
Just doing this for fun, no structure or commitments for now.

My other Advent of Code solutions:

- [Python](https://github.com/xvillaneau/adventofcode-python) (complete)
- [Golang](https://github.com/xvillaneau/adventofcode-golang)
- [Rust](https://github.com/xvillaneau/adventofcode-rust)
